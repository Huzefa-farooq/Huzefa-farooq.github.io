    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        Laparoscopic and robotic minimally invasive surgery is performed through small incisions using
        long, slender instruments. Although this reduces patient trauma, surgeons lose natural haptic
        feedback because these instruments isolate their hands from the tissue. This creates challenges
        in sensing applied forces and assessing tissue stiffness, increasing the risk of accidental tissue damage.
    </p>
<img src="P1_FlowDiagram.jpg" 
     style="width:75%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
        The objective was to design a smart laparoscopic tool that provides real-time haptic feedback to
        surgeons. This required developing an integrated sensing system capable of measuring both normal
        and shear forces using a flexible capacitive sensor, and estimating tissue stiffness using a
        position/angle sensor. The task also included creating a compact data acquisition board, wireless
        feedback mechanism (wearable band), and mechanical integration into a functional surgical grasper.
    </p>

<img src="P1_CalibrationSetup.jpg" 
     style="width:100%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">


    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
        Designed and fabricated a flexible capacitive force sensor and integrated it into a laparoscopic grasper.
        Developed the complete DAQ system using ESP32, AD7746, ADS1115, and AS5600 sensors. Built calibration
        setups, mapped capacitance to force, and performed simulations for normal and shear measurement.
        Redesigned the tool mechanism for safe sensor placement and implemented wireless haptic feedback
        using a wearable band and custom motor driver circuitry.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
        Achieved accurate measurement of force and stiffness with errors less than eight percent. Delivered a
        complete working prototype with real-time wireless sensing and haptic feedback. The project was
        selected for national innovation competitions including FICS and Ignite.

        <li>Signal Processing</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- S.T.A.R Format Content -->

    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        The NERC Indigenous Robotics Category required a fully autonomous mobile robot to navigate a themed arena,
        locate fruit trees, pluck ping-pong ball “fruits,” and collect them in a specified sequence. The rules enforced strict size limits and prohibited prefabricated driver modules, demanding an
        indigenous mechanical design, custom electronics, and reliable autonomous navigation.
    </p>
<img src="P2_ArenaTheme.PNG" 
     style="width:75%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
       As team lead, my task was to design, build, and program an autonomous fruit-harvesting robot from scratch.
        This included creating a mechanical plucking system, developing custom motor driver circuitry, implementing
        sensor-based navigation and line following, and coordinating the full integration so the robot could
        consistently pluck fruits from different trees and deliver them to the collection area within the time limit.
    </p>



    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
       I led the mechanical design of the robot chassis and plucking mechanism, using servos and linkages to grip
        and release the fruits. I designed and assembled an H-bridge based motor driver for the DC drive motors to
        comply with the indigenous hardware rules. On the software side, I programmed the Arduino in C to read
        multiple IR sensors, perform line following, detect tree positions, and trigger plucking and dumping
        sequences. I integrated the motion routines with servo control for the arm and container, and iteratively
        tested and tuned timing, speed, and sensor thresholds to achieve stable performance in the arena.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
        The robot successfully navigated the arena, plucked fruits from the required trees, and transferred them to
        the collector robot with high repeatability during trials. Our team’s robot met the competition constraints
        and performed reliably under time pressure, earning a first runner-up position at NERC and demonstrating our
        ability to deliver a complete autonomous mechatronic system.

    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        Isolated DC–DC converters are essential in EV chargers and energy-storage systems. Two topologies, Single Active Bridge (SAB) and Dual Active Bridge (DAB), offer different trade-offs in complexity, soft-switching behavior, and bidirectional power flow. A comparative study was needed to understand which is better for high-power applications.

     style="width:75%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
      Model and simulate both converters in MATLAB/Simulink, evaluate their performance under varying load conditions, and compare efficiency, current stress, and soft-switching capability to guide topology selection.
    </p>

    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
       Built detailed SAB and DAB converter models with phase-shift control, simulated their operation in CCM and DCM, analyzed switching waveforms, transformer utilization, and power transfer characteristics, and documented performance differences through controlled test cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
       Showed that SAB is simpler and cost-effective but limited in soft-switching range, while DAB provides higher efficiency and full bidirectional power flow, making it better suited for EV and energy-storage systems. Delivered validated comparison models and clear design insights.

    <h2>Battery Fuel Gauge Modeling in MATLAB</h2>

    <h3>Tools Used</h3>

        <li>MATLAB</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Skills Used -->
    <h3>Skills Used</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>Numerical integration</li>

        <li>Battery management system concepts</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- S.T.A.R Format Content -->

    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        Modern battery powered systems rely on accurate estimation of internal battery states for safe and reliable
        operation. States such as state of charge, internal resistance, and remaining runtime cannot be measured
        directly and must be inferred from voltage and current data through a software based battery fuel gauge.
    </p>

   

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
        The task was to implement a complete battery fuel gauge model in MATLAB using experimental voltage, current,
        and time data. This included estimating battery capacity, generating a pseudo OCV curve, creating a
        voltage based SOC lookup, estimating internal resistance, computing SOC through Coulomb counting, and
        predicting time to shutdown under a given load profile.
    </p>

    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
        Implemented numerical integration of current to estimate charge and discharge capacity. Constructed an
        averaged pseudo OCV curve by combining charging and discharging characteristics and used it to build a
        voltage based SOC lookup. Estimated internal resistance from voltage steps during current pulses and
        implemented Coulomb counting for SOC tracking with clipping for stability. Finally, combined SOC,
        internal resistance, and cutoff voltage to estimate remaining time to shutdown, and visualized all
        intermediate and final results using MATLAB plots.
    </p>

         style="width:75%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">
    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
        Delivered a working MATLAB based battery fuel gauge capable of estimating capacity, SOC, internal resistance,
        and remaining runtime from only voltage and current measurements. The model reproduced expected battery
        behaviour across the data set and demonstrated how software algorithms inside a battery management system
        can infer hidden battery states from measurable signals.
