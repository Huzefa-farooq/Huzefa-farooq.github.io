    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        Laparoscopic and robotic minimally invasive surgery is performed through small incisions using
        long, slender instruments. Although this reduces patient trauma, surgeons lose natural haptic
        feedback because these instruments isolate their hands from the tissue. This creates challenges
        in sensing applied forces and assessing tissue stiffness, increasing the risk of accidental tissue damage.
    </p>
<img src="P1_FlowDiagram.jpg" 
     style="width:75%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
        The objective was to design a smart laparoscopic tool that provides real-time haptic feedback to
        surgeons. This required developing an integrated sensing system capable of measuring both normal
        and shear forces using a flexible capacitive sensor, and estimating tissue stiffness using a
        position/angle sensor. The task also included creating a compact data acquisition board, wireless
        feedback mechanism (wearable band), and mechanical integration into a functional surgical grasper.
    </p>

     style="width:100%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">


    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
        Designed and fabricated a flexible capacitive force sensor and integrated it into a laparoscopic grasper.
        Developed the complete DAQ system using ESP32, AD7746, ADS1115, and AS5600 sensors. Built calibration
        setups, mapped capacitance to force, and performed simulations for normal and shear measurement.
        Redesigned the tool mechanism for safe sensor placement and implemented wireless haptic feedback
        using a wearable band and custom motor driver circuitry.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
        Achieved accurate measurement of force and stiffness with errors less than eight percent. Delivered a
        complete working prototype with real-time wireless sensing and haptic feedback. The project was
        selected for national innovation competitions including FICS and Ignite.

    </ul>

    <!-- S.T.A.R Format Content -->

    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        The NERC Indigenous Robotics Category required a fully autonomous mobile robot to navigate a themed arena,
        locate fruit trees, pluck ping-pong ball “fruits,” and collect them in a specified sequence. The rules enforced strict size limits and prohibited prefabricated driver modules, demanding an
        indigenous mechanical design, custom electronics, and reliable autonomous navigation.
    </p>
<img src="P2_ArenaTheme.PNG" 
     style="width:75%; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:5px;">

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
       As team lead, my task was to design, build, and program an autonomous fruit-harvesting robot from scratch.
        This included creating a mechanical plucking system, developing custom motor driver circuitry, implementing
        sensor-based navigation and line following, and coordinating the full integration so the robot could
        consistently pluck fruits from different trees and deliver them to the collection area within the time limit.
    </p>



    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
       I led the mechanical design of the robot chassis and plucking mechanism, using servos and linkages to grip
        and release the fruits. I designed and assembled an H-bridge based motor driver for the DC drive motors to
        comply with the indigenous hardware rules. On the software side, I programmed the Arduino in C to read
        multiple IR sensors, perform line following, detect tree positions, and trigger plucking and dumping
        sequences. I integrated the motion routines with servo control for the arm and container, and iteratively
        tested and tuned timing, speed, and sensor thresholds to achieve stable performance in the arena.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
        The robot successfully navigated the arena, plucked fruits from the required trees, and transferred them to
        the collector robot with high repeatability during trials. Our team’s robot met the competition constraints
        and performed reliably under time pressure, earning a first runner-up position at NERC and demonstrating our
        ability to deliver a complete autonomous mechatronic system.

    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        Isolated DC–DC converters are essential in EV chargers and energy-storage systems. Two topologies, Single Active Bridge (SAB) and Dual Active Bridge (DAB), offer different trade-offs in complexity, soft-switching behavior, and bidirectional power flow. A comparative study was needed to understand which is better for high-power applications.

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
      Model and simulate both converters in MATLAB/Simulink, evaluate their performance under varying load conditions, and compare efficiency, current stress, and soft-switching capability to guide topology selection.
    </p>

    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
       Built detailed SAB and DAB converter models with phase-shift control, simulated their operation in CCM and DCM, analyzed switching waveforms, transformer utilization, and power transfer characteristics, and documented performance differences through controlled test cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
       Showed that SAB is simpler and cost-effective but limited in soft-switching range, while DAB provides higher efficiency and full bidirectional power flow, making it better suited for EV and energy-storage systems. Delivered validated comparison models and clear design insights.

    <h2>EV Energy Consumption and Battery Pack Modeling</h2>

        <li>Data processing and visualization</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- S.T.A.R Format Content -->

    <h3>Situation</h3>
    <p>
        Accurate prediction of electric vehicle energy consumption and driving range is critical for
        battery sizing and performance evaluation. Different drive cycles, such as UDDS and US06, impose
        varying dynamic loads on the vehicle, and the choice of battery pack configuration directly
        affects current draw, state of charge, and overall efficiency.
    </p>


    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>
        Model EV energy consumption in MATLAB by simulating real-time power demand over UDDS and US06 drive
        cycles, and evaluate battery behavior for two pack configurations: Tesla 2170 (96S46P) and 4680
        (92S9P). Compute pack current, SOC, and efficiency and use these results to estimate practical
        driving range for each configuration.
    </p>

    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>
        Built a MATLAB-based model of traction power that included aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance,
        inertial effects, regenerative braking, and auxiliary loads. Computed battery pack current from
        drive-cycle power demand and incorporated pseudo OCV–SOC characteristics for the selected cells.
        Implemented an SOC estimator and simulated both battery configurations across UDDS and US06, then
        analyzed current profiles, SOC depletion, and energy consumption for each case.
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>
        Demonstrated how drive-cycle aggressiveness and pack configuration affect current stress, SOC
        trajectory, and vehicle range. Obtained realistic energy consumption and range estimates for both
        the 2170 and 4680 pack designs and provided clear comparisons that highlight the trade-offs between
        capacity, efficiency, and operating conditions.
